# IcePlayground
Ice is generally known to be static. However, ice comes in different shapes, hence different masses. Lighter ice naturally would be very easy to lift and more dynamic. In CG, however, even seemingly static ice is often displayed dynamically to express magical phenomenons. This work explores ways we can use “ice” as a theme to create a beautiful interactive work without breaking the static perception of ice.

My knowledge in shader programming is very shallow so I also read around half of this book as a reference.
